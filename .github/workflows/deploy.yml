# üö® DEPRECATED - This workflow has been replaced by the new CI/CD pipeline
# 
# The new CI/CD setup consists of:
# - ci.yml: Continuous Integration (testing, linting, building)
# - cd.yml: Continuous Deployment (automated deployment after CI success)
# 
# This file is kept for reference but should not be used.
# To deploy, push to main branch and the new CD pipeline will handle deployment automatically.
