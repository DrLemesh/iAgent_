✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-monorepo-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve react-app
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build react-app
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project react-app
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```

# Assistant UI - Nx Monorepo

This is an Nx monorepo containing a React application with assistant UI and a NestJS backend for event streaming chat API.

## Project Structure

- `apps/react-app/` - React frontend application with assistant UI
- `backend/` - NestJS backend with chat API and event streaming

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
PORT=3001
```

3. Start the backend:
```bash
npx nx serve backend
```

4. Start the frontend (in a new terminal):
```bash
npx nx serve react-app
```

## Features

- **React Frontend**: Modern chat interface with assistant UI components
- **NestJS Backend**: Event streaming API for real-time chat responses
- **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-4 powered conversations
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time response streaming for better UX
- **CORS Enabled**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup

## Development

### Frontend
The React app runs on `http://localhost:4200` and includes:
- Assistant UI with sidebar and thread components
- Radix UI components for modern design
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript support

### Backend  
The NestJS backend runs on `http://localhost:3001` and provides:
- `/api/chat` endpoint for chat interactions
- Event streaming responses
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- CORS configuration for frontend communication

## API Usage

Send POST requests to `http://localhost:3001/api/chat` with:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user", 
      "content": "Hello!"
    }
  ],
  "system": "You are a helpful assistant"
}
```

The API returns streaming responses compatible with the assistant UI framework.
